### Product Catalog QA Automation Suite

This is a starter/learning project to help me learn more about Playwright, Load Testing, API and JSON usage in an Automation/QA Environment.
I will create my own API's and make End-to-end tests with Playwright and do some load testing with K6. I'm creating my own API's for the sake of
practicing load testing in an isolated environment.
